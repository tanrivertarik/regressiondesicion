# Regression Models

This repository contains implementations of various regression models using Python. Each model is provided as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.

## Models Included
1. **Decision Tree Regression** (`decision_tree_regression.ipynb`)
2. **Multiple Linear Regression** (`multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`)
3. **Polynomial Regression** (`polynomial_regression.ipynb`)
4. **Random Forest Regression** (`random_forest_regression.ipynb`)
5. **Support Vector Regression** (`support_vector_regression.ipynb`)

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tanrivertarik/regressiondesicion.git
   cd regression-models
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
   Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory, then start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open any of the provided `.ipynb` files to explore and run the models.

## Model Descriptions
- **Decision Tree Regression:** A non-linear regression model that splits the data into segments using decision trees.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** A linear approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- **Polynomial Regression:** An extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable as an nth degree polynomial.
- **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble method that fits multiple decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Support Vector Regression:** A regression model that uses the support vector machine algorithm to predict continuous values.
